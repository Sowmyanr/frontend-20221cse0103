              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                LuxeHome began with a simple vision: to make beautiful, high-quality furniture accessible to everyone. 
                Founded in 2020, we started as a small boutique with a curated collection of handpicked pieces.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we've grown into a destination for design enthusiasts and homeowners looking to create 
                spaces that reflect their unique style and personality. Our collection has expanded to include 
                furniture, lighting, and decor from established and emerging designers.
              </p>
              <p>
                What hasn't changed is our commitment to quality, craftsmanship, and creating pieces that stand 
                the test of time. We believe that your home should be a reflection of who you are, and we're here 
                to help you create spaces you love.
              </p>
